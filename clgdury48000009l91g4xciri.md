## Introduction

This article is very personal to me, for a lot of reasons. One of which is that when I first got into web development, this was the bane of my existence. I would spend time mulling this over before I basically started any design. This was of course before I started using friendlier CSS frameworks like TailwindCSS and Bootstrap.

***I have a personal belief that the choice to start with either mobile or desktop is dependent on the learning trajectory you followed, or the tutor/instructor you learned from.***

If you learn from an instructor who develops mobile-first, you are more likely to follow this pattern and vice versa.

However, I decided to do a little bit more research about this topic, and show the two sides of the coin, so that everyone is aware of where they are standing.

## Overview

Mobile-first and desktop-first development are two approaches to designing and building web applications. Each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on the specific project requirements and target audience.

## Mobile-first

Mobile-first development involves designing and building the mobile version of a website or application first and then expanding it to the desktop version. This approach prioritizes the needs of mobile users, who are becoming increasingly important as more people access the internet on mobile devices. Mobile-first development often focuses on simplicity, speed, and usability, which can lead to a better user experience on all devices.

### Advantages:

1. Prioritizes the needs of mobile users, who are becoming increasingly important.
    
2. Focuses on simplicity, speed, and usability, which can lead to a better user experience on all devices.
    
3. Helps developers to create a responsive design that adapts well to different screen sizes.
    

### Disadvantages:

1. May neglect certain desktop-specific features, such as hover effects or complex interactions.
    
2. Can be challenging to scale up to larger screens, as the design may not have been intended for them.
    

## Desktop-first

Desktop-first development, on the other hand, involves designing and building the desktop version of a website or application first and then optimizing it for mobile devices. This approach has traditionally been the standard, as desktop computers were the primary way people accessed the internet. Desktop-first development often focuses on visual design, advanced functionality, and larger screens, which can lead to a richer user experience on desktops but can be more challenging to translate to mobile devices.

### Advantages:

1. Allows for more advanced functionality, larger screens, and richer visuals.
    
2. Provides developers with more design flexibility and opportunities for creativity.
    
3. May better support desktop-specific features, such as hover effects or complex interactions.
    

### Disadvantages:

1. May not provide an optimal user experience on mobile devices.
    
2. Can be more challenging to create a responsive design that adapts well to different screen sizes.
    
3. May neglect the needs of mobile users, who are becoming increasingly important.
    

## Conclusion

In summary, the choice between mobile-first and desktop-first development depends on the specific project requirements and target audience. However, as more and more people use mobile devices to access the internet, mobile-first development is becoming increasingly popular and important.
