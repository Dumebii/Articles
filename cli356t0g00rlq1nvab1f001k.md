Hello and welcome!! ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©

Today, we will get into what it is really about ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ **THE ALMIGHTY CSS**

CSS is...

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1684692369812/41afb6ce-039f-4f36-8b64-57ba8fbd567e.jpeg align="center")

*CSS is about to become the bane of your existence as a web developer.*

***CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content. Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements.***

CSS, when added to HTML, is what gives all the color and style to a website. If you recall from our [first HTML lesson](https://dumebi.hashnode.dev/learn-frontend-web-development-in-12-days-1), we had an example of what a website looks like with just pure HTML, that is, without any styling.

Let us get right into it!!! ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³

***NB: Remember, in our*** [***article***](https://dumebi.hashnode.dev/learn-frontend-web-development-in-12days-setting-up-development-environment)***, we discussed how to add a CSS file to our HTML document using the*** `<link>` ***element. For those using a local IDE, for you to follow along with this lesson, you have to add the link to your Javascript file to your HTML document using the*** `<link>` ***element contained in our*** `<head>` ***element.***

## Types of CSS

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1684971575507/b6de8e1b-12cf-42ba-9757-538d7a51cfaa.png align="center")

There are three types of CSS, or three methods of including our CSS in the HTML document

* Inline CSS
    
* Internal/ Embedded CSS
    
* External CSS
    

**Internal CSS:** This features a `<style>` tag in the HTML document's `<head>` section. This CSS style is a good approach to styling individual pages.

We can use the internal CSS by embedding it in our HTML `<head>` element, like so

```xml
<head>
<!-- Insert boilerplate code -->
<style type="text/css">
body {  
    background-color: black;  
}  
h1 {  
    color: white;  
    padding: 50px;  
}  
</style>
</head>
```

Inside here, we see that our CSS commands are written directly in our HTML. Don't worry about trying to understand the CSS for now. We will get into it shortly.

**External CSS:** In external CSS, we link the HTML to the external `.css` file, just as had learned in our [Setting up the development environment](https://dumebi.hashnode.dev/learn-frontend-web-development-in-12days-setting-up-development-environment) article. This is a more efficient method for styling a website. By editing the `.css` file, we can change the whole site at once.

After creating the CSS file, we link it to the HTML document.

```css
.xleftcol {  
   float: right;  
   width: 35%;  
   background:#608800;  
}  
.xmiddlecol {  
   float: right;  
   width: 35%;  
   background:#eff3df;  
}
```

This is what a standard external CSS document looks like.

**Inline CSS:**

Inline CSS is used to style a specific HTML element. Add a style attribute to each HTML tag without using the *selectors*. Managing a website may be difficult if we use only inline CSS. However, inline CSS in HTML is useful in some situations. In the following example, we have used the inline CSS in `<p>` and `<h1>` tag.

```xml
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html> 
<!-- Insert boilerplate code --> 
<body style="background-color:white;">  
<h1 style="color:Red;padding:20px;">CSS Tutorials</h1>  
<p style="color:blue;">It will be useful here.</p>  
</body>  
</html>
```

## CSS Syntax

CSS code, despite where it appears, whether as a stand-alone document or written in the HTML file, has a general syntax.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1684972086359/93d932a1-464a-418b-8b82-25b39b6c87ba.png align="center")

In CSS, we have the selector, the property being worked on, and the style value assigned to that selector. Basically, selectors are representations of our HTML in our CSS code. CSS code is separated by semi-colons `;` . In the image above, there are two CSS inputs separated by a semicolon. The `color` and `font-size` properties.

***CSS code is written with small letters, and compound words are hyphenated. Example:*** `font-size`***.***

## CSS selectors

CSS selectors are used to select the HTML element you want to style. Selectors are part of the CSS rule set. CSS selectors select HTML elements according to their id, class, type, attribute, etc.

There are several different types of selectors in CSS.

1. CSS Element Selector
    
2. CSS Id Selector
    
3. CSS Class Selector
    
4. CSS Universal Selector
    
5. CSS Group Selector
    

**Element selector:** The element selector selects the HTML element by its name.

</iframe>

**Id selector:** The id selector selects a specific HTML element with its `id` attribute. An id is always unique within the page so it is chosen to select a single, unique element. It is written with the hash character (#), followed by the `id` attribute of the element.

  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.
</iframe>

**Class Selector:** The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific `class` attribute. It is used with a period character `.` (full stop symbol) followed by the class name.

There are other forms of selectors, that you can read up on [Here](https://www.javatpoint.com/css-selector).

## CSS Box Model

In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout. The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: `margins`, `borders`, `padding`, and the actual content. The image below illustrates the box model:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1684973428829/a6ba6f3b-3620-428e-b90d-7e49b1be015e.png align="center")

Explanation of the different parts:

* **Content** - The content of the box, where text and images appear
    
* **Padding** - Clears an area around the content. The `padding` is transparent. The padding property can be modified using the, `padding-left`, `padding-right`, `padding-top`, and `padding-bottom` *sub-properties.*
    
* **Border** - A border that goes around the padding and content. The `border` is transparent. The padding property can be modified using the, `border-left`, `border-right`, `border-top`, and `border-bottom` *sub-properties.*
    
* **Margin** - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent. The `margin`is transparent. The padding property can be modified using the, `margin-left`, `margin-right`, `margin-top`, and `margin-bottom` *sub-properties.*

## CSS Units

CSS has several different units for expressing a length.

Many CSS properties take "length" values, such as `width`, `margin`, `padding`, `font-size`, etc. **A length** is a number followed by a length unit, such as `10px`, `2em`, etc.

***Note: A whitespace cannot appear between the number and the unit. However, if the value is,*** `0`***, the unit can be omitted. For some CSS properties, negative lengths are allowed.***

Read, and understand more about CSS units [here](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_units.asp).

## Some common CSS properties and their uses

<iframe height="300" style="width:100%" src="https://codepen.io/dumebii/embed/bGmZVVV?default-tab=html%2Cresult">

The CSS properties in the example above do not even begin to scratch the surface of all the CSS properties or sub-properties available for use.

***As a developer, it is important that we learn to leverage the power of Google (or our search engine of choice) to help us with concepts that are difficult to understand or even remember. As with HTML, there are so many CSS properties, and you are not required to remember all of them at once. This is why you should make various documentations your best friends. For web development, there are some pretty good documentations that you can check out:*** [***W3schools***](https://www.w3schools.com/)***, which we have referenced a lot.*** [***MDN web docs***](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) ***also.***

Yaaay!! Congratulations, you just finished your first class in CSS!

I am so excited! I had so much fun writing this. I hope you have as much fun reading, and practicing this, as I did writing it.

See you all next week in our advanced CSS class!
