The question 'when is the best time to sleep as a techie' , or 'how many hours of sleep should a techie get' is pretty big today, and there have been numerous answers.

The thing is, there is no hard and fast rule as to when you should sleep as a techie, or how many hours of sleep you should get.

***My take on this is: everyone should endeavour to sleep on time***

Sleeping on time varies per person, per personality and quite frankly per stage in life.

No one invented the time when children ought to sleep, but like clockwork, when it gets to a particular time, they sleep off. No matter how adamant they were about staying up to watch the *adult shows.* It just happens.

I think this principle applies to everyone. You will sleep when you have to sleep. No one needs to tell you when, you'd just know, either as intuition or your body's inability to hang on much longer.

Of course, as adults, it is possible that we've missed our body's sleeping cues so much that they don't even work anymore, and we now walk around like sleepless zombies, hopping from one YouTube video on how to sleep properly to the next. This is a sad situation, and you should probably seek (medical) help, or adopt reading a book.

***I should also add that not everyone is required to sleep in the night, at least for extended periods of time. Some people do better sleeping during the day.***

People like this work through the night, and when it is day, it just becomes a lot easier for them to get a good sleep.

In conclusion, sleep is a pretty important part of human living and one that no one should neglect at all.

Regardless of when (or how) you sleep, just ensure that you sleep at all.

Cheers. üòÅ
